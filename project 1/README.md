### Plot Full Map of India Using `.xyz` or `.txt` File

This project involves plotting the map of India using topographic data provided in a `.txt` or `.xyz` file. The data is first converted to a CSV format and then visualized using PyGMT. The steps include:

1. **Data Conversion**: Convert the text data to CSV format for easier manipulation.
2. **Full Map Plotting**: Plot the entire map of India using the CSV data.

### Plot Land and Water Portions of India Using `.xyz` or `.txt` File

This project involves plotting the land and water portions of India using topographic data provided in a `.txt` or `.xyz` file. The steps include:

1. **Cropping Land Portion**: Use a GeoJSON file to crop and focus on India's land portion.
2. **Water Portion Plotting**: Plot the water portion separately.
3. **Shapefile Integration**: Integrate shapefiles to enhance the map with additional geographical features.
4. **Merging Plots**: Merge the land and water plots together. (Note: Nepal, China, Bhutan, and Bangladesh are not included in the plot.)
